# Ask user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Print the results
print("Addition: ", addition)
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction)
