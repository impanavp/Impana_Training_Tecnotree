      <p><strong>Srinivasa Ramanujan</strong> (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory, continued fractions, and infinite series. He was self-taught and had an extraordinary ability to derive new mathematical results independently. His work has had a profound impact on the field of mathematics and continues to inspire mathematicians today.</p>
      <p>Despite facing significant challenges in his personal and professional life, Ramanujan continued to pursue his passion for mathematics. He published several papers during his short life and collaborated with several prominent mathematicians, including G.H. Hardy.</p>
      <p>Some of Ramanujan's most famous contributions to mathematics include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Ramanujan Prime</li>
        <li>The Ramanujan Theta function</li>
        <li>The Ramanujan Summation</li>
        <li>The Ramanujan Conjecture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Today, Ramanujan is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of mathematicians to pursue their passions and make groundbreaking discoveries.</p>
