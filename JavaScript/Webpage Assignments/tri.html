			<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was a renowned Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, especially in the areas of number theory and infinite series. Despite having no formal education in mathematics, Ramanujan developed his own unique approach to solving problems and produced numerous theorems and formulas that are still used today.</p>
			<p>Ramanujan's work was recognized by several leading mathematicians of his time, including G.H. Hardy, who invited him to study at the University of Cambridge in England. During his time in England, Ramanujan continued to produce groundbreaking work, but his health declined rapidly, and he returned to India, where he passed away at the age of 32.</p>
			<p>Ramanujan's legacy lives on today, as his work continues to inspire and influence mathematicians around the world. He is remembered as a brilliant and passionate mathematician who made significant contributions to the field, despite facing numerous obstacles throughout his life.</p>
