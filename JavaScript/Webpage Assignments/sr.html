		<p><strong>Srinivasa Ramanujan</strong> (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the field, particularly in the areas of number theory, mathematical analysis, and continued fractions.</p>
		<p>Despite having no formal training in mathematics, Ramanujan developed his own mathematical research in isolation. He made remarkable discoveries, including the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture, and independently discovered the Hardy–Ramanujan–Littlewood circle method, which he used to derive an approximate formula for the number of prime numbers up to a given limit.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, Ramanujan's health was poor throughout his life, and he died at the young age of 32. His legacy lives on, however, as his work continues to inspire mathematicians around the world.</p>
